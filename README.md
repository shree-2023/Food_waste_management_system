The proposed design model provides a robust framework for the development of a Food Waste Management Mobile Application that addresses the pressing issue of food waste while fostering community engagement and sustainable practices. By prioritizing user-centric design, scalability, security, and continuous improvement, the application aims to provide an intuitive and reliable platform for users to donate surplus food, connect with recipients, and contribute to reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity. Through seamless integration of modern technologies, stringent security measures, and ongoing feedback mechanisms, the application not only facilitates efficient food redistribution but also promotes awareness, collaboration, and positive social impact. With its emphasis on usability, scalability, and technological excellence, the design model sets the stage for the creation of a transformative solution that empowers individuals and communities to make a meaningful difference in the fight against food waste.
